## ‚ùì Research Questions
In our project, we are looking to solve the following questions
* Which emotions are more common in which movie genres? What are the typical patterns of emotion intensities for the most prevalent genres?
* Are emotion intensities and sentiment score good predictors for box office revenue? How do other factors such as main character gender, runtime, and country come into play?
* How do movie sentiments compare over different time periods?

## üìä Plots

### Part II: Genre-Emotion Analysis
#### Emotion Quantification 
We employ two metrics for evaluating emotions in movie plot summaries and titles:

* Heat map: emotion intensity vector for each genre.
* Bar chart: compare average sentiment scores across genres.
* Radar chart: display the emotion profile for each genre.

#### Cluster Analysis
* Scatter plots with clusters: clustering of emotion intensity vectors.
* Dendrogram: show how genres are grouped in hierarchical clustering.

#### Genre Definition by Emotion
* Word clouds: represent the most common emotions associated with each genre.
* Pie chart: show the proportion of different emotions in defining each genre.

#### Emotion along the Plot
* Line graphs: see changes in sentiment scores throughout the movie plot.
* Area chart: depict the variation in sentiment intensities across different plot sections.

#### Time-Based Emotional Trends
* Time series line plots: show genre-specific emotion intensities over time.
* Stacked area charts: visualize how different emotions within a genre have trended over time.
* Comparative bar charts: compare emotion intensity trends across different time periods.

### Part III: Emotion as a Predictor
#### Machine Learning
* Feature importance bar chart: show importance of each feature in predicting BOR??
* Confusion matrix: visualize performance of the classification model.
* ROC curve: Assess model performance across different classification thresholds

#### Regression Analysis
* Coefficient plot: visualize the regression coefficients.
* Scatter plot with regression line: show correlation between emotion intensities and BOR.
* Residual plots: assess the fit of the regression model.
